# SpaceShips
This is a game I created using the most basic Java libraries I could, including Swing, and libraries to test for keyboard and mouse inputs. 
I was hoping to test and demonstrate my ability to create a game from the ground up, without using pre-build physics programs or similar things.

Detailed graphics were not the main area of focus for this project. In game entites are represented are represented by circles and squares.

The simplest way to play the game is to just download the jar file and run it.
